SpeakUp 🎤

A GenAI-powered Debate & Discussion Platform for Students

🚀 Project Overview

SpeakUp is a modern debate and discussion platform designed to give students a voice. The goal is to create engaging, structured, and factually sound conversations powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

The platform allows users to step into a debate room, pick a topic, and interact with AI-driven moderators or peers in a safe, dynamic, and insightful way.

🎯 Project Goals

This project explores the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the latest techniques like:

Prompt engineering to craft meaningful debate prompts

Structured JSON outputs for clean, organized responses

Function calling for dynamic advice and automated flows

Optional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for factual accuracy in debates

All while keeping the experience fun, interactive, and educational.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend:

React.js (Vite + Tailwind CSS / Chakra UI for UI)

Interactive debate room interface

Backend:

Node.js + Express.js

Integration with OpenAI / LLM APIs for debate generation

Database:

MongoDB (for user sessions, debate logs, and preferences)

Vector Database (for embeddings and retrieval)

Hosting / Deployment:

Netlify (Frontend)

Render / Vercel (Backend)

🧠 Concepts & Features Used
🔹 Prompting Techniques

Zero-shot prompting – generating debates without prior examples

One-shot prompting – guiding the model with a single example debate

Multi-shot prompting – richer context with multiple examples

Chain-of-thought prompting – encouraging step-by-step reasoning in arguments

Dynamic prompting – adjusting prompts based on user input

System & User prompts – separating instructions from student queries

🔹 LLM Control & Tuning

Temperature, Top-K, Top-P – fine-tuning debate creativity vs. accuracy

Stop sequences – controlling where responses should end

🔹 Functionality & Output

Function calling – enabling AI to fetch facts or structure arguments dynamically

Structured output – returning responses in JSON for easy rendering

Tokens and tokenization – optimizing input size and cost

🔹 Similarity & Retrieval

Embeddings – semantic representation of debate topics

Cosine similarity, Dot product similarity, L2 distance – comparing arguments and finding related debates

Vector database – storing and retrieving debate context

🔹 Testing & Evaluation

Evaluation datasets – testing AI’s debate quality
Testing framework – measuring accuracy, coherence, and fairness

📌 Example Use Case

A student joins a debate room and selects a topic: “AI replacing jobs – good or bad?”

The system generates structured pro vs. con arguments using multi-shot + chain-of-thought prompting.

AI dynamically provides fact-checked insights using RAG + embeddings.

Students interact, add counterpoints, and the system ensures fairness with structured outputs.

✨ Conclusion

SpeakUp combines LLM intelligence with debate culture to create an environment where students learn to argue, reason, and collaborate effectively. With cutting-edge prompt engineering, similarity search, and structured outputs, this project is both a learning tool and a demonstration of GenAI’s potential.

📘 Project Concepts & Techniques

This project explores several GenAI concepts, prompting methods, and similarity measures. Below is a clear explanation of each, along with how to implement them.

🔹 Prompting Techniques
1. Zero-Shot Prompting

What it is: Asking the model a question without giving it any examples.

Example: “Translate Hello, how are you? into French.”

How to use: Directly pass the query to the model without additional context.

2. One-Shot Prompting

What it is: Providing one example before asking the real question.

Example:

Example: “Translate Good morning → Bonjour”

Query: “Translate Good night → ?”

How to use: Add a single demonstration in your prompt.

3. Multi-Shot Prompting

What it is: Giving multiple examples so the model learns the pattern.

Example:

“Translate Good morning → Bonjour”

“Translate Good night → Bonne nuit”

Query: “Translate See you tomorrow → ?”

How to use: Include several demonstrations in your prompt.

4. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

What it is: Asking the model to explain its reasoning step by step before answering.

Example: “Solve 23 × 47. Show your steps.”

How to use: Add “Think step by step” or “Show reasoning” in the prompt.

5. Dynamic Prompting

What it is: Prompts that adapt based on user input or system context.

Example: Generating a custom debate topic prompt based on user interests.

How to use: Build templates where placeholders ({{topic}}) are filled dynamically.

6. System and User Prompt

What it is:

System Prompt = sets rules (e.g., “You are a debate moderator”).

User Prompt = the actual input query.

How to use: Always define a clear system role + user input for better outputs.

🔹 Model Control Parameters
7. Tokens and Tokenization

What it is: Models read text in small chunks called tokens. Each word/symbol breaks into tokens.

Why important: Helps you manage input size and costs.

How to use: Check token counts with libraries like tiktoken.

8. Temperature

What it is: Controls creativity.

Low (0–0.3) → factual, focused.

High (0.7–1.0) → creative, varied.

How to use: Set in API call (temperature=0.7).

9. Top P (Nucleus Sampling)

What it is: Controls randomness by sampling from top probable words until probability P is reached.

Example: Top P = 0.9 means only keep words that make up 90% probability.

How to use: Adjust with top_p=0.9.

10. Top K

What it is: Restricts sampling to the top K most likely words.

Example: Top K=50 means only consider the top 50 probable next words.

How to use: Adjust with top_k=50.

11. Stop Sequence

What it is: Define a string where the model should stop generating.

Example: Stop at "###" to end structured outputs.

How to use: Pass stop=["###"] in API calls.

12. Structured Output

What it is: Forcing the model to return output in JSON or a specific format.

Example:

{ "topic": "AI", "stance": "for" }


How to use: Include format instructions in the prompt or use function calling.

🔹 Advanced Features
13. Function Calling

What it is: Model can call predefined functions with structured arguments.

Example: Extract event details → function create_event(name, date, location).

How to use: Define functions in API and let the model pick when to call.

14. Embeddings

What it is: Representing text as numerical vectors that capture meaning.

Use case: Search, recommendations, clustering.

How to use: Generate embeddings via API and store in a vector database.

15. Vector Database

What it is: A database optimized for storing and searching embeddings (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS).

Use case: Retrieve similar debates, documents, or past discussions.

How to use: Store embeddings and query with similarity search.

🔹 Similarity Metrics
16. Cosine Similarity

What it is: Measures angle between two vectors.

Range: -1 to 1.

Use case: Text similarity.

How to use: Compute with cosine_similarity(v1, v2).

17. L2 Distance (Euclidean Distance)

What it is: Straight-line distance between two points in vector space.

Use case: Clustering similar items.

How to use: Use NumPy or sklearn.

18. Dot Product Similarity

What it is: Measures alignment of two vectors. Higher = more similar.

Use case: Ranking similarity in embeddings.

How to use: np.dot(v1, v2).

🔹 Project Support Tools
19. Evaluation Dataset and Testing Framework

What it is: A way to test your prompts and model outputs with fixed questions and expected answers.

Use case: Ensure consistency and accuracy in debate moderation.

How to use:

Create test dataset (input → expected output).

Run prompts through it.

Measure accuracy/quality.

20. Create Project README

What it is: Documentation for your project.

Why important: Helps others understand, use, and contribute.
