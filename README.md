# SPEAKUP
SpeakUp 🎤

A GenAI-powered Debate & Discussion Platform for Students

🚀 Project Overview

SpeakUp is a modern debate and discussion platform designed to give students a voice. The goal is to create engaging, structured, and factually sound conversations powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).

The platform allows users to step into a debate room, pick a topic, and interact with AI-driven moderators or peers in a safe, dynamic, and insightful way.

🎯 Project Goals

This project explores the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) using the latest techniques like:

Prompt engineering to craft meaningful debate prompts

Structured JSON outputs for clean, organized responses

Function calling for dynamic advice and automated flows

Optional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for factual accuracy in debates

All while keeping the experience fun, interactive, and educational.

🛠️ Tech Stack

Frontend:

React.js (Vite + Tailwind CSS / Chakra UI for UI)

Interactive debate room interface

Backend:

Node.js + Express.js

Integration with OpenAI / LLM APIs for debate generation

Database:

MongoDB (for user sessions, debate logs, and preferences)

Vector Database (for embeddings and retrieval)

Hosting / Deployment:

Netlify (Frontend)

Render / Vercel (Backend)

🧠 Concepts & Features Used
🔹 Prompting Techniques

Zero-shot prompting – generating debates without prior examples

One-shot prompting – guiding the model with a single example debate

Multi-shot prompting – richer context with multiple examples

Chain-of-thought prompting – encouraging step-by-step reasoning in arguments

Dynamic prompting – adjusting prompts based on user input

System & User prompts – separating instructions from student queries

🔹 LLM Control & Tuning

Temperature, Top-K, Top-P – fine-tuning debate creativity vs. accuracy

Stop sequences – controlling where responses should end

🔹 Functionality & Output

Function calling – enabling AI to fetch facts or structure arguments dynamically

Structured output – returning responses in JSON for easy rendering

Tokens and tokenization – optimizing input size and cost

🔹 Similarity & Retrieval

Embeddings – semantic representation of debate topics

Cosine similarity, Dot product similarity, L2 distance – comparing arguments and finding related debates

Vector database – storing and retrieving debate context

🔹 Testing & Evaluation

Evaluation datasets – testing AI’s debate quality
Testing framework – measuring accuracy, coherence, and fairness

📌 Example Use Case

A student joins a debate room and selects a topic: “AI replacing jobs – good or bad?”

The system generates structured pro vs. con arguments using multi-shot + chain-of-thought prompting.

AI dynamically provides fact-checked insights using RAG + embeddings.

Students interact, add counterpoints, and the system ensures fairness with structured outputs.

✨ Conclusion

SpeakUp combines LLM intelligence with debate culture to create an environment where students learn to argue, reason, and collaborate effectively. With cutting-edge prompt engineering, similarity search, and structured outputs, this project is both a learning tool and a demonstration of GenAI’s potential.
